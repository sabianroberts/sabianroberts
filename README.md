# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a filmmaker, writer, composer, and software developer based in the United Kingdom. I founded "The Phoenix Project" and its Audio subsidiary which is currently an operating record label, and the Software Shared Volunteer Group (SVG), which makes zero-profit and creates projects on Valve's GoldSource (Half-Life) Engine.

On the software side of things I'm currently working on three projects - *Cross Product, The Classic Collection,* and *Halo: GoldSource.*

## Specifications
### Desktop PC
The main desktop PC I use is an Early 2009 Mac Pro 4,1 which has been flashed to the 5,1 firmware. It may be old, but it works perfectly for what I need it to do. To be honest, there are very few tasks where it really starts to show its age; however, this doesn't mean I'm ignorant to upgrading and will eventually have to advance to having a separate PC & Mac.

CPU: 1x Intel Xeon X5680 @ 3.33 GHz

GPU: AMD Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon RX 580 8 GB

RAM: 24 GB DDR3 triple-channel

Monitors: DELL S2817Q 28" 4K & Apple LED Cinema Display

Operating Systems: macOS 12.7.6 Monterey, Windows 11 Pro 22H2

Storage: 256 GB NVMe `TOSHIBA KXG50ZNV256G` SSD, 1 TB Pioneer `APS-SL3N-T1` SSD (bay 1), 1 TB Hitachi `HUA722010CLA330` HD (bay 2), 3 TB Seagate `ST33000650NS` HD (bay 3), 1 TB Apple `ST1000DM003Z HD (bay 4)

Optical Drives: Apple DVD-RW SuperDrive (bay 1), LG BD-RE WH16NS60 Drive (bay 2)

### Laptop
My laptop which I use for less demanding tasks is a Mid-2017 MacBook Pro 13". Again, it's pretty old, but I don't really use it for anything demanding.

CPU: Intel Core i5-7360U @ 2.30 GHz
